# To Do List

Project ideas suggested to me or that I thought of that interest me enough to consider it in the future.

1. "WAR" cardgame in C#
2.  ~~Rock paper scissors bot~~ Started work, [repo set up](https://github.com/AAAnothername/RockPaperScissors). Muy bueno.
3.  "Shitpost generator" grabs words from array and turns them into a shitpost sentence
4.  Ping Pong, somehow.
5.  Snake
6.  "Simple" "text-and-reaction" program. Say something to console, console responds.
