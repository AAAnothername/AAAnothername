2.  "WAR" cardgame in C#
3.  ~~Rock paper scissors bot~~ Started work, repo set up. Muy bueno. [See Repo Here](https://github.com/AAAnothername/RockPaperScissors)
4.  "Shitpost generator" grabs words from array and turns them into a shitpost sentence
5.  Ping Pong, somehow.
6.  Snake
7.  "Simple" "text-and-reaction" program. Say something to console, console responds.
